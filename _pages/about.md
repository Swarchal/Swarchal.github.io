I am a postdoctoral Researcher in a pharmaceutical company.

## Research interests

My interests revolve around high-content screening, data-analysis and making software tools to make things easier.

## Background

I carried out my PhD in the [Drug Discovery Group](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cancer-centre/research/carragher-group/drug-discovery) at the [Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cancer-centre) supervised by Prof. Neil Carragher. I spent my time performing compound screens across panels of breast cancer cell-lines using high-content imaging and making sense of the data afterwards.

From 2010 - 2014 I studied Pharmacology at the University of Bath. During this time I took year-long placement in the lab of Prof. David Sattelle using *C. elegans* as a platform for *in vivo* phenotypic screens in neurodegenerative disease models.
