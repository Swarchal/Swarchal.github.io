I am a PhD student at the [CRUK Edinburgh Centre](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cancer-centre) [Drug Discovery Group](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cancer-centre/research/carragher-group/drug-discovery).

## Research

My research focuses on analysing microscopy images to gain an understanding of drug mechanism-of-action. My work during my PhD has been applying these methods to profile phenotypic response between panels of cancer cell-lines in response to drug-like molecules.

## Background

From 2010 - 2014 I studied Pharmacology at the University of Bath. During this time I took year-long placement in the lab of Prof. David Sattelle using *C. elegans* as a platform for *in vivo* phenotypic screens in neurodegenerative disease models.

I am based in the Drug-Discovery group, supervised by Prof.Neil Carrager.

## Projects

- High-content image-based compound screens across panels of cancer cell-lines.
- Data analysis methods to compare phenotypic response between distinct cell-lines.
- Predicting mechanism of action of small molecules from cellular morphology.
- Making open-source software tools to streamline drug-discovery workflows.
