# YASSS - Yet Another Static Site Server

Having just made a [static site generator](https://github.com/swarchal/yasss)
the first post on it might as well be about how I made it since I don't have
any plans for what I'm going to write about.

A static site generator simply creates the necessary HTML to show some web pages,
there's no database or REST API, just HTML (maybe some simple javascript). The
world **does not** need another static site generator, there are probably thousands
and I would guess nearly all of them are better than this. But I'm stuck at
my parents house over Christmas and writing one in [nim](https://nim-lang.org)
sounded like a quick, easy project to amuse myself with.

I have used [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in the past which is my only experience
with these sort of things, so YASSS copies the basics from what I remember:
write some blog-style posts in markdown with a yaml header, run a command and
out pops your html files which can be rendered with something like github pages.
So for this I'm using soasme's
[nim-markdown](https://www.github.com/soasme/nim-markdown) library which
converts markdown to html and then sticking this directly in the body of a html
template using [nim-mustache](https://www.github.com/soasme/nim-mustache)
(again from soasme). I then link to these posts from a main `index.html`
template.


## Fetching posts
First we need to find all the markdown files in a given directory, in this case `./posts/`.
This should be fairly easy in most languages, in nim it's a case of:

```nim
import std/[os, sequtils, strformat]

proc getAllPosts(fpath: string = "./posts"): seq[string] =
  return walkFiles(fmt"{fpath}/*.md").toSeq().map(readFile)
```

This uses nim's `walkFiles()` with a wildcard to get only the markdown (.md) filenames
and then uses `readFile` to read the file into memory, returning a sequence where each
element is a post as a raw string.

## Parsing the frontmatter

The frontmatter is used as a way to store some basic metadata about the post such as
title, date, and whether it should be public. This is copied from jekyll where
they use a yaml header at the top of the markdown post between `---` lines like so:

```md
 ---
 title: my first post
 date: 2022-12-25
 public: false
 ---

 # heading
 ## subheading
 Content goes here.
```

In jekyll there's a whole load customisations you can put in the frontmatter,
but for this I'll stick with the title (as appears in the index), the date
which is used to sort the posts in the index, and public as a boolean flag
whether the posts should be made public or not. I've also added a description
value which is parsed, but this isn't used anywhere yet.

Now we could just fetch those lines between the `---` lines and parse them with
a yaml parser (or probably any other key-value parser), but I think there's already
enough dependencies in this project so I wrote my own bug-ridden key-value parser.

```nim
proc parseFrontMatter(text: string): FrontMatter =
  ## parse frontmatter from raw markdown text
  var
    isFrontMatter = false
    frontMatterLines: seq[string]
    title, formattedTitle, description, date: string
    public: bool = true
  for line in text.split("\n"):
    if line.startswith("---"):
      isFrontMatter = not isFrontMatter
      continue
    if isFrontMatter:
      frontMatterLines.add(line)
  # parse out key-value pairs from frontMatterLines
  for line in frontMatterLines:
    if line.startswith("title"):
      title = line.split(":")[^1].strip()
      formattedTitle = formatTitle(title)
    if line.startswith("description"):
      description = line.split(":")[^1].strip()
    if line.startswith("date"):
      date = line.split(":")[^1].strip()
    if line.startswith("public"):
      public = line.split(":")[^1].strip().toLower().startswith("t")
  return FrontMatter(
    title: title,
    formattedtitle: formattedTitle,
    description: description,
    date: date,
    public: public
  )
```

This has 2 steps, first get the lines between the two `---` delimiter lines:
```nim
var
  isFrontMatter = false
  frontMatterLines: seq[string]
for line in text.split("\n"):
  if line.startswith("---"):
    isFrontMatter = not isFrontMatter
    continue
  if isFrontMatter:
    frontMatterLines.add(line)
```

then the second step is to get the key-value pairs from those lines and
return it has a `FrontMatter` object:

```nim
for line in frontMatterLines:
  if line.startswith("title"):
    title = line.split(":")[^1].strip()
    formattedTitle = formatTitle(title)
  if line.startswith("description"):
    description = line.split(":")[^1].strip()
  if line.startswith("date"):
    date = line.split(":")[^1].strip()
  if line.startswith("public"):
    public = line.split(":")[^1].strip().toLower().startswith("t")
return FrontMatter(
  title: title,
  formattedtitle: formattedTitle,
  description: description,
  date: date,
  public: public
)
```

This is pretty ugly, it just checks the start of the line for the key value, and splits on `:`
to find the value, and I can already see how it would break if someone has a `:`
character in their title. So maybe it will get tidied up at some point.


## Parsing the markdown body
Parsing the markdown body is even easier, just loop through lines in the files
which aren't in the frontmatter, join them together into a single string and
use `nim-markdown` to convert the markdown contents to html.

```nim
import markdown

proc parseBody(text: string): string =
  ## get body from raw markdown text that includes frontmatter
  var
    body: seq[string]
    isFrontMatter = false
  for line in text.split("\n"):
    if line.startswith("---"):
      isFrontMatter = not isFrontMatter
      continue
    if not isFrontMatter:
      body.add(line)
  return markdown(body.join("\n"))
```

## Creating the post html from a template
The aim now is to stick the html (converted from markdown) into the body
of a simple html template. For this I'm using `nim-mustache` which implements
[mustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_\(template_system\))
as a templating language.

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p><a href="index.html">Back to posts</a></p>
    <hr>
    {{{ body }}}
  </body>
</html>
```

Here we insert a title into `{{ title }}`, and the body of the post in `{{{ body }}}`.
The body is within three curlies as we want to insert the raw html, otherwise
mustache escapes it for us which we don't want.

I've removed it from the above example, but there's also some highlight.js scripts
I'm pulling from a CDN so I can have syntax highlighting and mathjax to render $\LaTeX$.


## Creating the index page
The index page is just a list which links to each post in date order, so we're
just looping through the posts in a template.

The nim code:
```nim
proc createIndex(posts: seq[Post]) =
  ## create context for index template
  var frontMatters: seq[FrontMatter]
  for post in posts:
    frontMatters.add(post.frontMatter)
  frontMatters = frontMatters.filter(x => x.public == true)
  frontMatters.sort(cmpDate, Descending)
  let context = newContext(searchDirs=TemplateDir)
  context["posts"] = %frontMatters
  var
    index_html = "{{ >index }}".render(context)
    save_path = fmt"{PublicDir}/index.html"
  writeFile(save_path, index_html)
```

Which is made from the template:
```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Posts</h1>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      {{ #posts }}
      <li><a href="{{ formattedTitle }}.html">{{ date }}: {{ title }}</a></li>
      {{ /posts }}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```


## Github actions
I've yet to figure this out. I guess if you can read this then I did figure it out
but forgot to update this post.

My plan is to push posts in markdown to a github repository, and then have
github actions use YASSS to generate the HTML which is then accessible with
github pages. This should be simple in theory, there's plenty of tutorials
out there about using custom github actions with github pages.
